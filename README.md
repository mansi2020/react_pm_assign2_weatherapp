## Weather App

### Overview
This Weather App allows users to fetch weather information for different cities and display it in a tabular format. It consists of two tables: "City List" on the left and "Details" on the right. Users can interact with the app by clicking on buttons like "Get Weather" and "Search" to perform actions like fetching weather data, highlighting rows, editing descriptions, and deleting rows.

### Technologies Used
- React.js for frontend development
- CSS for styling

### Learning from the Project
This project helped in understanding how to integrate APIs to fetch data and display it dynamically in a web application. It also improved my skills in handling user interactions and managing state in React. Additionally, implementing dark mode and light mode functionality enhanced my understanding of styling and theme management.

### Future Improvements
- Implement pagination for better navigation through large datasets.
- Add error handling for API requests to notify users of any failures.
- Enhance styling and design for a more visually appealing interface.

### Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
5. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
